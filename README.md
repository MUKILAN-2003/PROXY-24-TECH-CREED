## üìò Overview
Students often struggle to keep up with lectures due to the fast pace, compounded by language barriers that make it difficult to comprehend concepts, especially for non-native speakers. This leads to challenges in understanding complex material, particularly when foundational concepts are not fully understood.

2. Language barrier: Non-native speakers struggle to comprehend content
3. Limited resources: Lack of accessible, simplified resources in multiple languages.
4. Non-native speakers: Often struggle with understanding and pronouncing subject-specific terminology in a foreign script

## Soluation Terminology
1. Lecture speed: Offer recorded lectures or slower-paced options to allow students to review at their own pace.

3. Limited resources: Create or offer supplementary materials in multiple languages and formats.
4. Non0native speakers: Using transliteration to convert subject-specific terminology into the student's native script, enabling easier pronunciation and understanding.
